**Effective date:** December 30, 2025

This policy explains how our website (the “Site”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information; the terms that govern use of the Site; and other important legal and operational information. By using the Site you agree to the terms described here. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site.

## 1. Privacy Policy

- **Information We Collect:** We may collect Personal Information you provide directly (such as name, email address, postal address, phone number) and non-personal information collected automatically (such as IP address, browser/device type, pages viewed, and referral data).
